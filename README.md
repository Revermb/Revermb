### Hello
My name's Reverb (or Revermb),

I am an IT and Networking student at kOsh Collegestraat.
overall I mainly code in C# but during my time at school I've also learned HTML (+ bootstrap), C (Arduino) and CSS.

I'm from Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª and I'm fluent in both Dutch and English.

Despite everything I am still learning so please be patient with me.
